This is an IRC client I built as my high school final project using C# and WPF, along with an IRC library (in C#).

The code is probably not super-pretty, but I don't want to throw it away. Maybe it can be useful to someone. :)

Also, it's missing two libs whose source I can't find any more (`CommonStuff` and `BasicMvvm`). Too bad.
